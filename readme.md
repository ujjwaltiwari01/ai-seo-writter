## Why Is This Template Useful?

If you manage a blog or website, you know that rewriting and updating content is one of the most effective ways to boost traffic. Even small updates, like adding new keywords or rewriting a few paragraphs, can make a big difference. However, doing this manually can be time-consuming and repetitive, especially when managing multiple posts.

This template automates the entire process, from identifying high-potential keywords to generating optimized content suggestions, making it an invaluable tool for content creators.

## What Does This Template Do?

This template simplifies and automates the data-driven optimization of your articles by:

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Checks if a Google spreadsheet exists for the article's optimization:
     - If it exists, adds a new sheet.
